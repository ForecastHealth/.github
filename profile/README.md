# The official website for Forecast Health

We build mathematical models that look at the impacts and costs of health interventions.

Forecast Health has a few aims:
- Building models
- Making simple tools that can be understood by health economists and policy makers alike
- Documenting our models and code with simple language

Specifically, we are doing the following things:
- Building a protocol for how state transition models should run: [View the repository here](https://protocol.forecasthealth.org)
- Implementing that protocol in Python (not publicly available yet)
- Building models in botech, and running them using the `botech-python` implementation
- Building modern apps that allow users to build and run those models

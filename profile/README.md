# The official website for Forecast Health Australia

Forecast Health has a few aims:
- Building models
- Sharing our code
- Documenting our models and code with simple language
- Doing these things for other people's models
- Having a transparent philosophy

On this GitHub page, we fulfill the second of these aims, by sharing our code.
We also share models we've built, and make web-apps where you can use them.

Specifically, we are doing the following things:
- Building a protocol for how state transition models should run: [View the repository here](https://github.com/ForecastHealth/botech-protocol)
- Implementing that protocol in Python (not publicly available yet)
- Building models in botech, and running them using the `botech-python` implementation

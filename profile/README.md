# The official GitHub page for Forecast Health Australia
(We don't have a standalone web-page, we do most things on GitHub)

Forecast Health has a few aims:
- Building models
- Sharing our code
- Documenting our models and code with simple language
- Doing these things for other people's models
- Having a transparent philosophy

On this GitHub page, we fulfill the second of these aims, by sharing our code.  
We also share models we've built, and host pages where you can use them.
